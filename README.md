# Trapezoidal Point Location – Visualization

A clean and educational visualization of the Trapezoidal Map Point Location Algorithm. This repository demonstrates how the algorithm incrementally constructs a trapezoidal map for a set of non‑intersecting segments and uses it to efficiently locate query points.

The core of the project is a Jupyter Notebook that builds and visualizes the algorithm step‑by‑step, accompanied by a GIF illustrating the full execution.

## 📘 Description

This project shows an **educational implementation** of the Trapezoidal Point Location algorithm. It focuses on:

* visualizing the creation of the trapezoidal map,
* showing how segments split existing trapezoids,
* demonstrating how the query structure evolves

The implementation is intentionally simple and optimized for clarity rather than performance.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is meant primarily as:

* a visual, educational explanation of the trapezoidal point‑location algorithm,
* a clean reference for students learning computational geometry,
* a readable example of how to animate geometric algorithms in Python.

## ▶️ Running the Notebook

This project is fully contained in a single Jupyter Notebook.

 ```bash
git clone repo https://github.com/matwoj8/Trapezoid_Point_Localization.git
cd Trapezoid_Point_Localization
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
